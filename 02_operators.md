# Operators

Each operator exposed in the interface should accomplish one task for the user. If a user often needs to use two or more operators in sequence to achieve something, they should instead be thought of as accomplishing one larger task and redesigned as one operator with multiple options. We want the user to be able to do as much as possible in as few clicks as possible, but still have the flexibility to use the operator in a variety of situations.
