# Orange Turbine's Blender Add-on Guidelines

This living document outlines Orange Turbine's current list of best practices for creating add-ons for Blender. We will use these guidelines as a default, but of course there are situations in which they *should* be deviated from, e.g. when building an add-on for a client that explicitly requests otherwise. We've decided to also post these guidelines publicly in an attempt to help standardize how add-ons are integrated into Blender, so that users can have a more cohesive experience.
